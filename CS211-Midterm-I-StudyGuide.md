# CS211 Midterm I Study Guide
## Recent Trends In Hardware
### Main Components In Computer
Include: Cpu, Memory, Bus, I/O Devices like keyboards, graphics, neworking, and storage.
### Von Neumann Model
Computers are seperated into three parts: memory, control unit, and arithmetic and logic unit. Moery stores data and instructions. The control unit fetches further instructions. the arithmetic and logic units do operations based on the instrucitons passed.
### Basic CPU Function
Fetch --> Decode --> Execute
### Running on Hardware
**High - Level Language**

```c
x = x + y;
```   
**Assembly Language**

```nasm
mov -0x8(%esp),
%ebx add %ebx, %eax
```  
**Machine Language**

```
7F 45 4C 46 01 01 01â€¦
```  
### Operating System
Provides essential services to programs running on hardware such as virtual memory, multitasking, etc...
### Moore's Law
An observation that the number of transistors on chip double every 18 month. Can also be seen in processor speed, memory capacity, and disk capacity, which doubles 18 months, two years and every year, relativly speaking.
## The C Language
### Compared to Java
Java source code is compiled into byte code, runs in the jvm and finally on the hardware and OS. C is compiled and run in the hardware and OS.
### Comments
Denoted using `/* */` or `//`
### Variable Declaration
Starts with an optional modifier, type and then the name. `short int x;` `long double y;` `char z;`
### Basic Datatypes
There exits: ***char***, ***int***, ***float***, ***double***, with modifiers ***short***, ***long***, and ***signed***, ***unsigned***.
### Arithmetic Operatiors
Contains `*, /, %, +, -, ++, --`. Remember that `x++` changes the value after it is used and `++x` changes the value before it is used. Same with `x--` and `--x`.
### Relational Operators
Include: `>, >=, <. <=, ==, !=`. The result is 1 (TRUE) or 0 (FALSE).
